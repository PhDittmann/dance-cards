# Dancing Cards
## LaTeX Calling Cards for historic dances

## All-in-one or separate Cards
The Cards are all in one big .tex file



## Other projects:
#### [Contracard by Sam Whited](https://ctan.org/pkg/contracard)
A LaTeX Package to make Calling Cards in a more standardized way. It defines a lot of moves as LaTeX commands and i find it more useful to just write free text. It does enable fun things like lookups for dance moves though.
